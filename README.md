# BG SCENE HACK CODE

Change these two lines in S_CharModel.as:

```angelscript
        Pilot2ItemId = msm.ItemCreate(SceneId, "CharacterPilot", "Skins\\Models\\HelmetPilot\\CreamyWirtual.zip", "");
        PilotItemId = msm.ItemCreate(SceneId, "CharacterPilot", "Skins\\Models\\HelmetPilot\\StadiumTestMesh.zip", "");
```

# Trackmania Menu Bg Reflections

This plugin let's you modify the reflection of the car in main menu backgrounds. It's spun-off of [Menu Background Chooser](https://openplanet.dev/plugin/menu-bg-chooser).

There are only two parameters: "opacity" and "angle". Neither is intuitive, but it's fun to mess around with nonetheless.

After you install the plugin, you need to go to a new menu, then back to the main menu for the plugin to start working.

**Note! This plugin uses developer hooks and thus may be fragile!**
