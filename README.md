# Trackmania Menu Bg Scene Randomizer

This plugin changes the menu background scene.
The original scene is the trackmania car with a driver.
The new scenes are many and varied.
What mysteries await you upon installing?
(Don't check the thumbnails, they have spoilers.)

The plugin becomes active when you reload the home page.
The easiest way to do this is click "settings" in the bottom left of the home page and then click "back", which is in the same spot.
(Click the left hand 1/2 of "settings" so that you can immediately click again.)

**Note! This plugin uses developer hooks and thus may be fragile!**
